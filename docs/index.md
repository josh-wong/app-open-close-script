# app-open-close script for syncing data in a Windows appðŸ¤–

By using the **app-open-close** Python script and adding it as a task in Task Scheduler in Windows, you can automate the process of opening a specific app, allowing data to sync, and then close the app.

This script can be particularly helpful for when you want to sync app data at regular intervals. By only opening the app when you need to sync data and then closing it after the data has finished syncing, you can reduce computing resource.
