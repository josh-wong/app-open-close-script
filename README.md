# Script for opening and closing a Windows appðŸ¤–

The app-open-close Python script opens a Windows app by using the app's URI, then closes the app after a specific amount of time.

By using this script, you can sync data automatically (in conjunction with Task Scheduler) or avoid constantly using CPU resources when the app doesn't need to be used.
